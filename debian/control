Description: Ansible based configuration framework for Debian servers
 DebOps is a administration framework for setting up remote Debian servers
 which is based on the configuration management system Ansible. For that
 purpose the project features a large collection of several refined Ansible
 scripts (playbooks and roles). With them a multitude of different services
 could be set up on one or a number of remote servers in the same run most
 conveniently. The scripts are written in a modular fashion and could be
 combined differently, as needed.
 .
 This package contains a collection of helper scripts for the use of the
 project's Ansible playbooks and rules which are contained in the package
 debops-playbooks. They provide additional functions like the creation
 of project directories and the encryption of the secrets folder.
